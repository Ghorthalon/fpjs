These folders contain sounds of objects that can be destroyed while playing. They may contain:
* loop.ogg: A sound that plays while the object hasn't been destroyed. This may be, for example, a clock ticking.
* dest.ogg: A sound that plays when this object is destroyed. 

Folder structure would look like this:
```
clock/
clock/loop.ogg
clock/dest.ogg
```
